# Lab2: Experimental Pong - Shrinking Paddles  

# Game Overview  
This is a twist on the classic Pong game where both paddles shrink every time a player scores. Instead of just trying to outscore the opponent, players also have to manage their shrinking paddle as the game gets harder. The match ends when a player reaches 10 points, and whoever still has enough paddle left to play is the winner.  


#  How to Play  
- Move your paddle up and down to hit the ball.  
- Every time someone scores, both paddles shrink. 
- First player to reach 10 points wins.
- Once the game ends, press any key to restart.


# What Makes This Version Different?  
- In regular Pong, scoring a point gives you an advantage. In this version, every point makes survival harder for both players. You have to adapt to smaller paddles while still playing the game. The longer the match lasts, the harder it becomes to block the ball. Winning isnâ€™t just about scoring it's about lasting long enough to stay in the game.


# Controls  
- Player 1: `W` (Move Up) | `S` (Move Down)  
- Player 2: `Up Arrow` (Move Up) | `Down Arrow` (Move Down)  
- Press Any Key After Game Over to Restart



# Design Choices  
The idea behind this version of Pong was to create a sense of increasing pressure as the match progresses. Unlike traditional Pong, where gameplay remains the same throughout, this version forces players to think differently about every point they score.  
- Shrinking paddles add a layer of difficulty and force adaptation.  
- Simple controls keep the game easy to learn but hard to master.  
- Neon visuals give the game a modern arcade feel.
